# ETLSSIS


ETL process with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
In this project I show a basic example of an ETC incremental data loading process that is applied to reality in the field of business intelligence. The exercise consists of loading a target database (a multidimensional database) with information just entered in a source database (relational database). Both databases are practically the same except that the target database is dimension-based.

Disclaimer: All data used is dummy data.
