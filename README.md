# ETL process with SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)

### Project overview

In this project I show a basic example of an ETC incremental data loading process that is applied to reality in the field of business intelligence. The exercise consists of loading a target database (a multidimensional database) with information just entered in a source database (relational database). Both databases are practically the same except that the target database is dimension-based.

### Data Sources 

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this ETL Process is: "VentasDM.sql", containing detailed information about sales.


### Tools
SQL Managment Studio Data Manipulation/ Data Analysis
Visual Studio - ETL Process
Optional: Power BI - Creating reports

### Data Cleaning / Preparation
